# The "Skill" of Ads - Enjoy scaling, simply

#### We are a performance-based digital ads agency, focused on building long-term, win-win partnerships based on trust and real results, rather than contracts and questionable progress.

#### We keep things simple, in all areas - from our small number of quality partners, to our barebones website - so we can focus on clean, original thinking and creativity to produce a strong ROI.


## The offer

Become one of our three partners:

- **Performance-based relationship** - we produce directly trackable results; pay nothing if we don't.

- **No contracts** - beyond the mandatory initial 3-month testing period, there are no commitments, for either party. We stay if it's a win-win.

- **Proven, current track record** - For example, in December 2020, we collected $2.2m for one partner, across Google and Facebook, at an average ROI of 12.3 (results are not typical).


## About you

The offer is open to you if:

- You run a relatively **simple, profitable, and ethical business** (or you're willing to focus on your most profitable revenue streams).

- You're willing and able to **quickly and easily scale** once ads are profitable (no major operational ceilings, budget constraints, or red tape) - so we both stand to make good money from our work together.

- You're happy to **leave us to do the work and produce results** - you're not going to feel uncomfortable with a lack of pretty charts and diagrams, and you certainly don't want 3 calls a week so we can try to convince you of the "hidden benefits" of more likes on your Facebook page.


## About us

- **Small by design** - We value Quality over quantity in all things, and we keep things simple so we're able to focus deeply on doing great work for the few, not the many.

- **"T-stacked" abilities** - Before founding, CH, our principal, worked in all domains of the customer experience - from grassroots events and awareness-based promotions for major brands like Škoda and VW, to cutting his teeth in cold-calling and door-to-door sales (business and consumer), and even developing high-end websites and marketing funnels (from high-level strategy down to button-clicking and coding), before really focusing in on digital advertising, and cultivating the "skill" of ads.

- **Fundamentals over fads** - Technology trends, marketing tactics, and even entire advertising platforms come and go... But the fundamentals of business, sales, and human nature - such as experimentation, creativity, and empathy - these stay largely the same. This is where the true "skill" in advertising is. If you have a firm grasp of the fundamental principles, you can invent your own tactics, and ride the trend "waves" as they come and go. But if you don't - no clever "trick" or ad acrobatics could possibly save you anyway.


## The typical process

- After filling out the **form** on this page, you'll get an email with a link to our calendar, where you can **schedule a call**.

- We'll hop on the call together and **discuss your business**. We'll go through a series of questions to understand your business and your goals to get a good feel for whether we'll be able to help you or not, and to see if it's a good fit. **If it's not, we'll tell you**.

- If it is, we'll work through terms and come to a **simple, win-win agreement** as quickly as possible. Usually, this involves a 3-month initial commitment (to give enough time to get things rolling and avoid unrewarded work), and performance-based pricing (such as taking a % of ad profits). If your funnel is unvalidated (i.e. has not been significantly profitable before, with data to prove it), or you need one built, there will be substantial setup and/or retainer fees until it's profitable enough, at which point we can switch format.

- Once that's done, we'll **collect what we need from you** and your team - like assets, account access, information on your business and your ideal customer, etc. Then we'll get to work, starting at high level strategy and working down to the details. We'll begin testing and experimenting as soon as possible, and we'll look to scale as soon as we're comfortably profitable.

- You and your team will receive basic spending and ROI reports, we'll hop on calls occasionally when it's genuinely useful, and we'll invoice you in alignment with our agreement. Our partnership will likely be **simple, effortless, and very mutually profitable**. Everyone's happy.



## Some honest caveats and final words

- **The primacy of the product** - You don't need us to tell you that no matter how good the marketing is, if you have a subpar product, service, or reputation, it won't be enough - in fact, it's likely to just spread that poor reputation faster. Therefore, it's best for everyone if you don't seek to advertise if you're not proud of the core of your business.

- **On the other hand** - If you _are_ proud of it, and you enjoy what you do, one of the benefits of using an ads partner is that it frees up more bandwidth for focusing on that core and improving the customer's experience. And then the customer's happier, the revenue's happier, and we're all happier. So it cuts both ways.

- **Realistic expectations** - Contrary to the unspoken general attitude nowadays, social media and other forms of online advertising are not "magic bullets", and they don't always strike gold right away. They can be extremely powerful, but again, the fundamentals have to be in place - and this means taking the time and money to experiment and find the right offer, for the right audience, at the right time, with the right messaging, and budget, and strategy...

- There are a lot of factors at play, and so digital ads aren't gamechangers for everyone. We vet thoroughly and try to sniff that out as soon as we can, and we only proceed with a partnership if we feel confident it will be a win-win. With that said, it is still an uncertainty, an experiment, a risk, for both parties. For this reason, **we do not guarantee anything, and we do not offer refunds under any circumstances**. By continuing, you understand and accept this.

If you select that, we won't reach out to you right away - instead, you'll receive no more than 1 email per _quarter_ from us, saying only: "Ready to work together?" - And if you're ready, you can just reply to that email and we'll go from there.
