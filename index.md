# The Skill of Ads
### How to get the business you deserve


## The offer

Become one of our three clients / partners...

- Performance-based relationship - we produce directly trackable results; pay nothing if we don't.
- No contracts - beyond the mandatory initial 3-month testing period, there are no commitments, for either party. We stay if it's a win-win.
- Proven, current track record - Eg. In December 2020, we collected $2.2m for a client across Google and Facebook at an average ROI of 12.3 (results not typical).


## About you

The offer is open to you if:

- You run a relatively simple, profitable, and ethical business (or you're willing to zoom in on the 1-3 most profitable parts of it).
- You're willing and able to quickly and easily scale once ads are profitable (no major operational ceilings, budget constraints, or red tape) - so we both stand to make good money from our work together.
- You're happy to leave us to do the work and produce results - you're not going to feel uncomfortable with a lack of pretty reports and diagrams, and you certainly don't want 3 calls a week so we can try to convince you of the "hidden benefits" of more likes on your Facebook page.


## About us

- We're small by design - We value quality over quantity in all things, and we keep things simple so we're able to focus deeply on doing great work for the few, not the many.
- "T-stacked" abilities - Before founding, Cameron, our principal, worked in all domains of the customer experience - from grassroots events and awareness-based promotions for major brands like Škoda and VW, to cutting his teeth in cold-calling and door-to-door sales (business and consumer), and even developing high-end websites and marketing funnels (from high-level strategy down to button-clicking and coding), before focusing in on digital advertising, and cultivating the "skill" of ads.
- Fundamentals over flash - Technology trends, marketing tactics, and even entire advertising platforms come and go... But the fundamentals of business, sales, and human nature (, creativity, experimentation... these) stay largely the same. This is where the true "skill" in advertising is. If you have a firm grasp of the fundamental principles, you can invent your own tactics. And if you don't - no chatbot or clever ad acrobatics could possibly save you anyway.


## The typical process

- After filling out the form on this page, you'll get an email with a link to Cameron's calendar, where you can schedule a call.
- We'll hop on the call and discuss your business. We'll go through a series of questions to understand your business and your goals to get a good feel for whether we'll be able to help you or not, and to see if it's a good fit. If it's not, we'll tell you.
- If it is, we'll work through terms and come to a simple, win-win agreement as quickly as possible. Usually, this involves a 3-month initial commitment (to give enough time to get things rolling and avoid unrewarded work), and performance-based pricing. If your funnel is unvalidated (has not been significantly profitable before, with data to prove it), or you need one built, there will be substantial setup and/or retainer fees until it's suitably profitable, at which point we can switch format.
- Once that's done, we'll collect what we need from you and your team - like assets, account access, information on your business and ideal customer, etc. Then we'll get to work, starting at high level strategy and working down to the details. We'll begin testing and experimenting as soon as possible, and we'll look to scale as soon as comfortably profitable.
- You and your team will receive basic spending and ROI reports, we'll hop on calls occasionally when it's genuinely useful, and we'll invoice you in alignment with our agreement. Our partnership will likely be simple, effortless, and very mutually profitable. Everyone's happy.



## Caveats and final words

- The primacy of the product - You don't need us to tell you that no matter how good the marketing is, if you have a subpar product, service, or reputation, it won't be enough - in fact, it's likely to just spread that reputation faster. Therefore, it's best if you don't seek to work with us if you're not proud of the core of your business.
- On the other hand - If you _are_ proud of it, and you enjoy what you do, one of the benefits of using an outside ads partner is that it frees up more bandwidth for focusing on improving the customer's experience. And then the customer's happier, the revenue's happier, and we're all happier. (As a side note, this is the same reason why we keep our own marketing so minimalistic - so we can focus more on what matters most - our partners' ads).
- Realistic expectations - Contrary to a popular opinion nowadays, social media and other forms of online advertising are not magic bullets. Again, it's about the fundamentals. The right offer, with the right timing, with the right budget and strategy, and the right messaging to the right audience... This combination can be very powerful. But there are a lot of factors, which is why we vet so thoroughly. Digital ads aren't fantastic for everyone, so we try to sniff that out as soon as we can, and will only proceed with a partnership if we feel confident it will be a win-win. With that said, it is still a risk, an experiment, for both parties. We do not guarantee results, and we do not offer refunds under any circumstances. By continuing, you understand and accept that.
